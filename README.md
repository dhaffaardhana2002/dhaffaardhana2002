# Dhaffa Ardhana's GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹
Hello everyone! I'm Dhaffa, just type dafa for simplicity. I'm in love with programming and coding. Basically, I like anything related to logical and math. And YES, math is my favorite!

My first programming experience was creating a web page using __HTML__, __CSS__, and __JavaScript__. Then I learn some database coding with __PHP__ and __MySQL__. I explored python because of its simplicity, and I had a few lessons on C++ during my computer engineering bachelor's degree at my campus. However, I decided to stop learning C++ due to the complexity of learning classes.

I've also made a very simple project, but unfortunately, I haven't finished it and it has been abandoned.
You can check out my [To-Do List](https://github.com/dhaffaardhana2002/todo-list) project on my GitHub.

Yep... that's right. However, I have some project that I haven't uploaded here, such as working website, roblox game, JavaScript, ect. Unfortunately, I couldn't host the Roblox game on Git, so i couldn't see my progress in it. So yeah, that's all I can say for now.

Thanks for reading this README.md, I apologize for everything I say in this profile, my English isn't perfect so I hope you can understand that I'm still improving.

Terima Kasih, __Dhaffa Ardhana__
